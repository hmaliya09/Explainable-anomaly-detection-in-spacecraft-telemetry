# Spacecraft Telemetry Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning-based system to detect anomalies in spacecraft telemetry data from NASAâ€™s Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions. The goal is to identify abnormal patterns that could indicate subsystem faults or failures, ensuring mission safety and reliability.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Feature Extraction**: Combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and moving average predictors to capture diverse anomaly characteristics such as waveform, frequency, and magnitude changes.
- **Multiple Classification Models**: Implements and compares ensemble methods (AdaBoost, Random Forest), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks for effective binary anomaly classification.
- **Performance Metrics**: Uses precision, recall, and F0.5 score to emphasize accurate anomaly detection while minimizing false positives.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Provides interpretability of model predictions to help spacecraft engineers understand and trust anomaly alerts.

## Dataset
The system is trained and validated on publicly available NASA telemetry datasets from the MSL and SMAP missions, containing labeled anomalies across multiple sensor channels.

## Usage
1. Preprocess raw telemetry data.
2. Extract features using LSTM, STFT, and moving average methods.
3. Train classification models on labeled data.
4. Evaluate model performance with cross-validation.
5. Use trained models to detect anomalies in unseen telemetry streams.
